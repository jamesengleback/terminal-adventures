#!/bin/sh
# this is a shell script
# the top line is called a "shebang"
# when we run an ascii text file, the program loader
# reads the top line to find out how to run it
# /bin/sh is the path to a shell interpreter
# which will be used to interpret the commands
# the shell interpreter ignores that line because a '#' 
# is a comment in many languaes
